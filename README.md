How to use:

After the download has finished, you need to write all passwords that you want to check for inside passwords.txt file line by line.

Save it and run "python3 checkmypass.py" inside your PowerShell Commander or Bash from an inside folder where did you already download the script. 

The script will recognize the passwords.txt file, read line by line and ask the API result for every line that u wrote
